###1.Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?


**First, being able to get an insider’s view of the things that made our life better and easier genuinely excites me.**
I started to become interested in programming about 8 years ago when I was working as an intern in a digital marketing / search engine optimisation company in Guangzhou. When I recall the whole experience, the best part was being educated on how to read through the website HTMLs, how to make it more search engine friendly, how to use different tools to optimise keywords, as well as how to write Wordpress blogs. The sense of being able to understand websites from a search engine’s point of view made me so proud that I talk about that experience to almost everyone I knew with great passion. I want to feel that passion again.

**Second, I believe that programming in a very near future would be something people expected to know, like English, so as to be exposed to more opportunities an automated world.**
Being a newbie mother thousands of miles away from original family’s support, I was desperately searching for resources that can equip my little one with the qualities and skills to be successful in the future. To my surprise, coding camps and classes now start from kindergarten! I refuse to be a mom that cannot understand her kindergarten child’s classes, or later not being able to join him in his daily conversation! Witnessing the rise of artificial intelligence in our everyday life, it is never more obvious that more and more jobs will be either facilitated or eliminated by technologies created by programmers. I hope I can be a part of the active power that changes the world instead of passively waiting for the changes to happen.

**Third**, I am recently eligible to work freely in the US and I am eager to get back to the job market. Foreseeably, my foreign education background and work experiences might not be widely recognized by recruiting companies, let alone that there’s a 2-year gap in my CV. **As one of the most desired skill set in the job market, programming would be of immense help to reach my career goal in a new country.**


**To expose myself to programming**, I started with the book __*HEAD FIRST JAVA 2nd edition*__. There is one thing that really impressed me in it: if we want to be persistent in learning something, we have to think of it as a matter of survival, as if we were in a cave with tigers outside. It is the only way to motivate us to pour in all time, energy and resource available to us. That is how I prioritize learning programming now. In addition, I watched the __*Java Programming for Beginners*__ videos on Youtube; I took the Coursera course on __*Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals*__; I went to some Python quick start free workshops organized by Achievian; I learnt __*HTML*__ through my previous internship I enjoy viewing website codes via *__developer mode*__ in chrome to see if I can figure out features/functionalities that I have never seen before.

###2.IF you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

In 5 years, my goal is to have enough __*programming knowledge, leadership qualities*__ and __*management*__ skills to be considered in a __management position in a major IT company in Seattle__. I hope that the company I work in will allow me to keep learning from interesting and talented people from diverse background, and to keep growing from solving challenging problems and leading my own project. 

###3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program

Being a full-time home-maker seeking to get back to work with a gap in the CV, a “legal alien” (as the government put it on the identity papers) who tries to fulfill her value in a new country, a mom who wants to educate children by being a role model, I understand from many facets what hinders women from rising from the difficulties to consider programing as their career: the exhaustion from child caring, the doubt they have for getting into the unknown, the alarming financial cost for a CS degree or a coding boot camp plus fulltime daycare, the mono-background social circle where they can hardly get technical support…

If I had the chance to join the community and succeed in having a fresh start, I would be more than happy to __*volunteer as a TA__* or an unpretentious __*mentor__* that gives one on one support __*give free quick-start workshops__* in libraries and schools to ease the intimidated feeling women often have towards coding __*advocate for Ada__* through social media and my personal/professional network, and __*connect alumni with companies__* that share the same vision. 

__*In the long run__*, I hope I can raise enough funding/resource to initiate a __*child caring service__* for __*full-time Ada moms__* who would like to get back to the job market. The cost of raising a child plus daycare fee alone can amount to a huge barrier that keeps moms from stepping forwards. When I can, I would like to __*support__* them __*personally and financially__* so that they can have time to focus on learning and improving themselves.

###4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

After graduating from the __*Master of Science in New Media__* program from the __*Chinese University of Hong Kong__*, I applied for a scholarship that would sponsor my tuition fee to study in a business school in Paris. Meanwhile, I found a job as a researcher in the __*City University of Hong Kong__*. The researcher job was great! My boss and I enjoyed working with each other and we made huge progress. 3 months later when I got the offer from __*ESSEC Business School in Paris__* with the scholarship, I proposed to continue the research work in Paris, because I was truly interested in the research topic “[Technologies for Transparency](https://globalvoices.org/2010/05/05/technology-for-transparency-in-china/)", and I was in need of an income to finance the high cost of living in Paris. When discussing arrangements with my boss, I assumed that studying in Paris would not be too stressful and I would find time to complete my work. After all, it was a country known by guaranteed 5 weeks annual vacation and 35 work hours per week. My boss had some doubt but she was convinced by my performance. She generously agreed. 

Sadly I was being naive. Studying in a top business school means everybody around you were not only super smart, they were also super hardworking. Plus, group projects and lectures literally took all my time and energy. I pulled numerous all-nighters to complete the research. __*As hard as I tried, it was not enough to maintain the same level of quality as my previous work.__* My boss ended up paying for extra help to make sure that everything’s solid by the publishing deadline. When the project was done, we ended our contract with such a bitter and sorrow taste that I sent back half the money I received from her after the relocation. I failed her terribly and I felt so bad.

This was the biggest mistake I made in my professional life. I learnt __*4 things__* from it. __*First,__* time and energy is limited. We are not superman/superwoman and we have to respect and admit these boundaries. __*Second,__* always prioritize tasks and focus on the most important, one step at a time. For the rest, delegate, seek help or say no. __*Third,__* there are always unexpected difficulties in any kind of group work. The best way to achieve optimal team result is to keep the progress transparent, and to communicate timely with the team, so that we can work on solutions together. __*Four,__* our work is our brand. It took a lot of work to build a personal brand, but a small neglect or the lack of respect can easily destroy it. We can never take our commitment to work too seriously.

__*If I encountered this situation again__*, I will communicate with my boss immediately after I find that it is beyond my limits to do a full-time degree and a full-time job at the same time. Then I would assist her finding a replacement and assist with the transition. In regard to the shortage of income, I would ask my family for support while checking availability of student loans and looking for part-time jobs that require less commitment.
